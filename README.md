C# deck-of-cards code sample
----------------------------

Here is some C# sample code that provides a deck of cards that can be sorted and shuffled.

The project was created in VS2015 Community edition.

This was developed using BDD with SpecFlow (a Cucumber implementation for .NET).  Installation 
instructions are here: <http://www.specflow.org/getting-started/>.  Put simply, you can open
Visual Studio and go to Tools --> Extensions and Updates and install SpecFlow.  

The Visual Studio project is already set up so you can use Test --> Run --> All Tests to fire 
up the tests.  Since SpecFlow is in evaluation mode, it'll take a few seconds for the tests 
to start.
